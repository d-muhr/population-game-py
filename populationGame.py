'OPTIONAL TODO: alternative name for the animal: proconamals/ proconimals

'''


'''NOTES
- There are several aspects of this script that can be adjusted to change the game dynamics
and therefore the strategy the player has to make use of. You can find the most important
ones when you look for "ADJUSTABLE" in the script.

(((- When the inhabitants need e.g. 1 animal per person for 1 year it is
calculated backwards and still makes sense. The extra food already
during the pregnancy is considered. So if the growth factor determines
that after 1 year it is 100 people,  they will have needed 1
animal for each person (even babies) for this year in the past. So if
the user's decisions did not make this possible, the village will have
starved.)))
